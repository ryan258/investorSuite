# Masterplan: AI-Powered Future Scenario Generator

## 1. Project Overview

The AI-Powered Future Scenario Generator is a tool designed to explore and visualize positive future outcomes enabled by artificial intelligence. By leveraging advanced AI models, this project aims to create a "crystal ball" that helps users understand potential paths towards a better world through AI advancements.

### Main Goal
To create an AI-powered tool that generates and visualizes optimistic future scenarios, helping users steer towards positive outcomes in AI development and implementation.

### Target Audience
Individuals and organizations interested in exploring how AI can contribute to making the world a better place. This includes futurists, policymakers, AI researchers, and anyone passionate about positive AI outcomes.

## 2. Key Features

1. User Input System
   - Allow users to input their ideas or prompts for future scenarios
   - Provide AI-generated topic suggestions if no input is given

2. AI-Powered Scenario Generation
   - Utilize OpenAI's "gpt-4o-mini" model to generate detailed future scenarios based on user input or selected topics

3. Timeline Visualization
   - Implement a visual component for rendering timelines of generated scenarios
   - Include major milestones, potential breakthroughs, and critical decision points

4. Investor Sentiment Analysis
   - Track and display projected investor sentiment over time for AI-related industries and companies

5. Stakeholder Mapping
   - Identify and visualize key companies and organizations with significant stakes in the generated AI scenarios

6. Modular, Object-Oriented Design
   - Ensure the codebase is organized into modular components for easy maintenance and future expansion

## 3. Technical Stack

- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and Vue.js for interactivity
- AI Integration: OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini model) with structured output
- Data Visualization: D3.js or Chart.js for timeline and sentiment visualization

## 4. User Interface and Experience

- Home Page:
  - Clean, intuitive interface with a prominent input field for user prompts
  - "Generate Scenario" button
  - Option to view AI-generated topic suggestions
- Results Page (/app route):
  - Display generated scenarios with interactive timelines
  - Show investor sentiment trends and stakeholder information
  - Provide options to regenerate or modify scenarios

## 5. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
1. Set up project structure and backend server
2. Implement user input system and AI topic generation
3. Integrate OpenAI API for scenario generation
4. Create basic frontend for input and displaying results

### Phase 2: Data Visualization
1. Implement timeline visualization component
2. Add investor sentiment analysis and visualization
3. Develop stakeholder mapping feature

### Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancements
1. Refine home page design and user input experience
2. Create the /app route for displaying detailed results
3. Implement interactive elements for exploring generated scenarios

### Phase 4: Optimization and Testing
1. Optimize API calls and data processing
2. Implement error handling and input validation
3. Conduct thorough testing and bug fixing

## 6. Potential Challenges and Solutions

1. API Rate Limiting
   - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls
   - Consider batch processing for generating multiple scenarios

2. Scope Creep
   - Maintain a clear project scope and prioritize features
   - Use agile methodologies to manage feature implementation

3. Ensuring Output Quality
   - Implement filters and post-processing to ensure generated content is relevant and appropriate
   - Consider human-in-the-loop validation for critical scenarios

## 7. Future Expansion Ideas

1. User Accounts (Low Priority)
   - If needed in the future, implement a simple user authentication system
   - Allow users to save and share their generated scenarios

2. Collaborative Scenario Building
   - Enable multiple users to collaboratively edit and refine scenarios

3. Integration with Real-world Data
   - Incorporate current news and technological trends to inform scenario generation

4. Scenario Comparison Tool
   - Allow users to compare multiple generated scenarios side-by-side

## 8. Security and Privacy Considerations

While user authentication is not a current priority, ensure that:
- API keys and sensitive configuration data are properly secured
- User inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- Generated content is screened for potentially sensitive or inappropriate information

## 9. Conclusion

This AI-Powered Future Scenario Generator aims to provide users with a powerful tool for exploring positive AI futures. By focusing on modular design and core functionality, the project can quickly deliver value while remaining flexible for future enhancements.
