# Masterplan: AI-Powered Future Scenario Generator

## 1. Project Overview

The AI-Powered Future Scenario Generator is a tool designed to explore and visualize positive future outcomes enabled by artificial intelligence. By leveraging advanced AI models, this project aims to create a "crystal ball" that helps users understand potential paths towards a better world through AI advancements.

### Main Goal
To create an AI-powered tool that generates and visualizes optimistic future scenarios, helping users steer towards positive outcomes in AI development and implementation.

### Target Audience
Individuals and organizations interested in exploring how AI can contribute to making the world a better place. This includes futurists, policymakers, AI researchers, and anyone passionate about positive AI outcomes.

## 2. Key Features

1. User Input System
   - Allow users to input their ideas or prompts for future scenarios
   - Provide AI-generated topic suggestions if no input is given

2. AI-Powered Scenario Generation
   - Utilize OpenAI's "gpt-4o-mini" model to generate detailed future scenarios based on user input or selected topics

3. Timeline Visualization
   - Implement a visual component for rendering timelines of generated scenarios
   - Include major milestones, potential breakthroughs, and critical decision points

4. Investor Sentiment Analysis
   - Track and display projected investor sentiment over time for AI-related industries and companies

5. Stakeholder Mapping
   - Identify and visualize key companies and organizations with significant stakes in the generated AI scenarios

6. Modular, Object-Oriented Design
   - Ensure the codebase is organized into modular components for easy maintenance and future expansion

## 3. Technical Stack

- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and Vue.js for interactivity
- AI Integration: OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini model) with structured output
- Data Visualization: D3.js or Chart.js for timeline and sentiment visualization

## 4. User Interface and Experience

- Home Page:
  - Clean, intuitive interface with a prominent input field for user prompts
  - "Generate Scenario" button
  - Option to view AI-generated topic suggestions
- Results Page (/app route):
  - Display generated scenarios with interactive timelines
  - Show investor sentiment trends and stakeholder information
  - Provide options to regenerate or modify scenarios

## 5. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- [x] Set up project structure and backend server
- [x] Implement user input system and AI topic generation
- [x] Integrate OpenAI API for scenario generation
- [x] Create basic frontend for input and displaying results

### Phase 2: Data Visualization
- [x] Implement timeline visualization component (interactive, expandable)
- [x] Add investor sentiment analysis (basic; advanced visuals in progress)
- [x] Develop stakeholder mapping feature (basic; advanced visuals in progress)

### Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancements
- [x] Refine home page design and user input experience
- [x] Create the /app route for displaying detailed results
- [x] Implement interactive elements for exploring generated scenarios (recursive expansion)

### Phase 4: Optimization and Testing
- [ ] Optimize API calls and data processing
- [ ] Implement error handling and input validation (in progress)
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing and bug fixing (in progress)

## 6. Potential Challenges and Solutions

1. API Rate Limiting
   - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls
   - Consider batch processing for generating multiple scenarios

2. Scope Creep
   - Maintain a clear project scope and prioritize features
   - Use agile methodologies to manage feature implementation

3. Ensuring Output Quality
   - Implement filters and post-processing to ensure generated content is relevant and appropriate
   - Consider human-in-the-loop validation for critical scenarios

## 7. Future Expansion Ideas

1. User Accounts (Low Priority)
2. Collaborative Scenario Building (planned)
3. Integration with Real-world Data (planned)
4. Scenario Comparison Tool (planned)

## 8. Security and Privacy Considerations

While user authentication is not a current priority, ensure that:
- API keys and sensitive configuration data are properly secured
- User inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- Generated content is screened for potentially sensitive or inappropriate information

## 9. Conclusion

This AI-Powered Future Scenario Generator aims to provide users with a powerful tool for exploring positive AI futures. By focusing on modular design and core functionality, the project can quickly deliver value while remaining flexible for future enhancements.
